# Javascript features
By default, the bundled libraries being used are:
- modernizr
- GSAP(TweenLite)

You can add other libraries by adding new bundles from config.babel.js.
Make sure to install the dependency first and add the appropriate file location to the browserify config from the config.babel.js file.

### Modernizr configurations
Edit the Modernizr features from the `_src/assets/_data/modernizrData.js` directory.

for more information refer to the modernizr documentation.
