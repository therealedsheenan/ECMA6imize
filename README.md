# ECMA6imize
ECMA6imize is a custom gulp task runner that supports ES6 features.

###Install gulp and babel globally.
```
npm install gulp -g
```
```
npm install babel -g
```
####Important Notes:
- Make sure that you have gulp v3.9 on both CLI and local.
- If you get errors from installing gulp or babel, try adding `sudo` before the command.
- Running `gulp` only won't load the default task. Read the instructions below for further details.

###Run Gulp Development mode
```
gulp development
```
###Run Gulp Production mode

```
